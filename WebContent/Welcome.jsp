					Multi-level Marketing are generally considered to be synonyms, and
					a subset of direct selling. While "direct selling" and "network
					marketing" refer primarily to the distribution system, the term
					"multi-level marketing" emphasizes the compensation plan more.
					Network Marketing tends to be modern preferred term,however many
					other terms are also used, including word-of-mouth marketing,
					interactive distribution, relationship marketing and others.
					Critics have argued that the use of different terms and "buzzwords"
					is an effort to distinguish multi-level marketing from illegal
					Ponzi schemes, chain letters, and consumer fraud scams.</td>
